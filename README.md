### Disclaimer

This engine was written by 15 year old me. It is riddled with bugs and dubious technical decisions. Despite it's problems, which are many, it works well.

### Purpose

I decided to implement a chess board from scratch in python using pygame. After having done so, I decided to add an AI to play against, in case the player is lonely. 

### Features

- Full chess board & chess piece implementation
- Complete move validation and promotion logic
- Opponent that uses minimax and alpha-beta pruning to decide it's next move
- Terrible function and variable naming (promotionStuff()? Really?)

### Quickstart

Install the only dependency - pygame
Launch chess_game.py
Enjoy!
